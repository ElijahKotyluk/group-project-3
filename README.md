# Group Project 3

## Technologies
This project uses:

[Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) for a NoSQL database.

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) For an HTTP Server

[VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) For a JavaScript runtime

This project makes use of a logging utility I created called [trunks](https://github.com/aturingmachine/trunks).

## Installation

To install this project simply clone or download the repo:

`git clone  <dir name>`

`cd <dir name>`

`npm install`

add in your local Mongo URI **Changing the PORT variable in the .env will require you to change it in the `views/config/http.js` file.**

### Setup/Development

To develop using this project you can run

`npm run dev:serve`

and

`npm run dev:client`

in separate terminal instances. This will allow hot reloading of both changes to the server and changes to the client.

The server will require you to be running a local instance of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

`npm run static` will build the client-side JavaScript and start the hot reloading of the server environment. `npm run dev:serve` can also be used to just start the API if you are working on that prior to worrying about the client.

#### Scripts

A more detailed breakdown of the scripts are as follows:

| Command `npm run`| Server | Client |
| :------------- |:------------- |:-
| `start`| Static| Static (requires `npm run build`)
| `dev:serve`      	| Hot reload | Static
| `dev:client` 		| None | Hot Reload
| `build` | None | Bundled by Webpack
| `static` | Hot reload | Bundled by Webpack

### Project Structure

##### Backend

`/src/`

`--/controllers/`-- Contains controllers for our API resources.

`--/database/`

`----/models/`-- Contains the models for our API Resources using [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/).

`--/middleware/`-- Any middleware you may need can go here.

`--/routes/`-- All route definitions are here.

`----/api.js`-- Routes for the API.

`----/user.js`-- Routes specific to the user resource.

##### Frontend

`/views/`

`--/config/http.js`-- Axios config for local request

`--/router/index.js`-- Config for [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)

`--/App.vue`-- Component that has Nav-Drawer, Footer, and Toolbar wrapped around a router view of other components.

`--/main.js`-- Registers the Vue components and Router

`--/index.html`-- The file we return, has the Vue app in it.

### Requirements

This project will require:

* Node >=7.0

### Dependencies

* Dependencies Via NPM
	* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) For client side HTTP requests
	* [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) For CORS during development
	* [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) Loads our .env variables
	* [vue](https://vuejs.org/) Realtime data binding on the frontend
	* [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) Router for the SPA

### User Resource
The example resource is as follows

| Attribute     | Type         | Required|
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:  |
| `name`      	| String 		| `true`  |
| `age`      	| Number        | `true`  |
| `email` 		| String        | `true`  |


### Existing Routes

All user endpoints are behind the `/api` endpoint.

#### `GET`
`/users` - returns a list of all users inside of an array called `data`.

`/users/:id` - where `:id` is the id of a `user` resource. The resource is then returned in JSON format.

#### `POST`
`/users` - Creates a new `user` resource based on the payload of the request.

#### `DELETE`
`/users/:id` - Delete a user resource matching the `:id` specified.

#### `PUT`
`/users` - Update a user based on the payload of the request

##

The Client can be accessed by hitting the document root:

`localhost:8080/` Will send you to the application.
