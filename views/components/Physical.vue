        <p class="card-text">Power Walk - The point of speed walking is to flex and contract those leg muscles by walking at a fast 
          rate of speed while also avoiding having both feet off the ground like you would when running or jogging. In this exercise, 
          you sould also utilize your arms and sway them opposite your left and right feet. This excersices puts less strain on 
          your knees as it would for jogging.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jogging Continuously - Be sure to stretch before and after. Attempt to start running at a medium 
          pace so that you can sustain your energy for a longer period of time. Start jogging and track to see how long you can last. 
          After you figure that out you can calculate that if you can last for 20min continuously, challenge yourself to jog out for 
          10min and jog back in 10min or less. Push yourself at a further distance to increase your time.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Push Ups - Start by getting on your belly and push yourself off the ground as many times as you can. The trick behind gaining 
          muscle is not to push yourself off the ground rapidly for quick pumps, rather you should slowly push yourself off the ground and contracting 
          you muscle groups. As a bonus, apply some wights or get a chair to put your feet on.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Squats - This activity will not only help improve muscle tone to your legs but will help when lifting things off the ground 
          in a better posture which will avoid the use of your lower back muscles. If you are attending a gym or want to work out from home, it is 
          important to stretch before and after. While doing this exercise, remember to focus on contracting your leg muscle groups for a better result.
           Avoid squating with too much weight or else your leg muscles will be stressed which will not get you results.</p>
